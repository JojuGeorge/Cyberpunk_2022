PLAYER ATTACK

** Gun types
	pistol	(small) 
	Rifle, machine guns, sci-fi large gune	(large)
	
** Animation
	Small Gun
		taking
		shooting	with idle or walk or run	
		aiming		with idle walk or run 		// in current implementation aiming is turned off when player walks -  there fore aiming while running - needs
													new mechanics????
												
		Idle		player goes to idle by lowering arms - happens when player starts to move, else will be in aiming pose
	
	
	Large Gun
		aiming		with idle or walk or run
		shooting	with idle walk or run
			// Single shot && Auto shot option needed
		

** multiple gun swapping mechanics

** Mechanics
when clicking on fire then
	* for small guns selected, by default idle anim only. And on clicking fire then shoot then in aim pose until the player walks, then goes to idle
		// but then no (aim | shoot) + walk for pistol - new mechanics?
		// One idea is to add a null slot, so player speed with gun | aiming is slow, but with empty more speed???  -- mobile version?
		// aim -> idle ? aim + walk ?
	
	* for large guns selected, by default goes to aiming pose. And on clicking fire button then shooting animation, then aiming
	
	set shoot parameter as true - GENERIC?
		or for pistol and large guns different boolean parameter for animation??
		(based on large or small gun do respective animations)??
	
	Based on Gun selected do animation ???
	
	
** Gun Mechanics
	WeaponSlots = null && Pistol && AutomaticGun && LargeGun
	
	if (WeaponSelected == null ){
		Normal idle;
		Normal Walk;
		Normal Run;
		Walk && Run speed == MAX
	}
	if (WeaponSelected == Pistol || AutomaticGuns || LargeGuns){
		Gun aim idle
		Gun aim Walk + Shooting
		Gun aim Run + Shooting
		Walk && Run speed < MaxSpeed
	}
